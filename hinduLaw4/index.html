    <p id="HMA"><strong>The Hindu Marriage Act is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted in 1955 which was passed on
        18th of May.<br>The main purpose of the act was to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus
        and others. Besides amending and codifying Sastrik Law, it also included separation and divorce, which also
        exist in Sastrik Law. This enactment brought uniformity of law for all sections of Hindus. In India there are
        religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of certain other religions.<br> Read More About
